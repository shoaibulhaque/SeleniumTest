# test_form.py Documentation

This Python script is a unit test file that tests the functionality of a form on a web page. It uses the unittest module for the testing framework, and Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

## Step-by-step Breakdown

1. **Import necessary modules and classes**: The script begins by importing the necessary modules and classes. This includes `unittest` for the testing framework, `webdriver` from Selenium for browser automation, and `WebDriverWait`, `expected_conditions`, and `By` from Selenium for handling waits and locating elements.

2. **Define the FormTest class**: This class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, which means it's a test case that will be run by the unit test framework.

3. **Define the setUp method**: This method is run before each test method. It initializes a new instance of the Chrome WebDriver and assigns it to `self.driver`.

4. **Define the test_form method**: This is the main test method. It does the following:
   - Navigates to the webpage at "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".
   - Waits until the form fields are clickable, then assigns them to variables. The fields include "name", "email", "phone_number", and "address".
   
Note: The code excerpt provided ends at this point. However, based on typical form testing scripts, the following steps are likely to be included:

5. **Fill in the form fields**: The script would typically use the `send_keys` method to input test data into the form fields.

6. **Submit the form**: The script would typically locate the form's submit button and use the `click` method to submit the form.

7. **Check for a success message**: The script would typically wait until a success message appears on the page, then check that it's displayed using an assertion method from the `unittest` module.

8. **Define the tearDown method**: This method is run after each test method. It closes the WebDriver, effectively closing the browser window.

9. **Main execution**: If the script is run as the main program (as opposed to being imported as a module), it calls `unittest.main()`. This function runs all the test methods in the script.
