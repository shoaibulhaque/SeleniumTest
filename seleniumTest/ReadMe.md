# Web Form Testing Project

This project is a simple Python script that uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation to test a web form. The script is structured as a unit test using Python's built-in `unittest` module.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and Selenium WebDriver installed on your machine. You'll also need a WebDriver for the browser you want to use (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## How It Works

The script navigates to a webpage, waits until the form fields and submit button are clickable, fills in the form fields with test data, submits the form, and then checks for a success message.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python test_form.py
